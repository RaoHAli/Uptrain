**[UpTrain](https://uptrain.ai)** is an open-source tool to evaluate LLM applications. UpTrain provides pre-built metrics to check LLM responses on aspects such as correctness, hallucination, toxicity, etc. as well as provides an easy-to-use framework to configure custom checks.

# Pre-built Evaluations We Offer üìù

#### Evaluate the quality of your responses:
1. [Response Completeness](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/response_quality/completeness.ipynb): Grades how if the response completely resolves the given user query.
2. [Response Relevance](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/response_quality/relevance.ipynb): Grades how relevant the generated response is for the given question.
3. [Response Conciseness](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/response_quality/conciseness.ipynb): Grades how concise the generated response is i.e. the extent of additional irrelevant information in the response.
4. [Response Matching](): Operator to compare the llm-generated text with the gold (ideal) response using the defined score metric.
5. [Response Consistency](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/response_quality/consistency.ipynb): Grades how consistent the response is with the question asked as well as with the context provided.

#### Evaluate the quality of retrieved context and response groundedness:
1. [Factual Accuracy](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/context_awareness/factual_accuracy.ipynb): Checks if the facts present in the response can be verified by the retrieved context
2. [Response Completeness wrt Context](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/context_awareness/response_completeness_wrt_context.ipynb): Grades how complete the response was for the question specified with respect to the information present in the context
3. [Context Relevance](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/context_awareness/relevance.ipynb): Evaluates if the retrieved context contain sufficient information to answer the given question

#### Evaluations to safeguard system prompts and avoid LLM mis-use:
1. [Prompt Injection](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/safeguarding/system_prompt_injection.ipynb): Identifys prompt leakage attacks


#### Evaluate the language quality of the response:
1. [Tone Critique](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/language_features/tone_critique.ipynb): Assesses if the tone of machine-generated responses matches with the desired persona.
2. [Language Critique](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/language_features/language_critique.ipynb): Scores machine generated responses on multiple aspects - fluence, politeness, grammar, and coherence.

#### Defining custom evaluations and others:
1. [Guideline Adherence](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/custom/guideline_adherence.ipynb): Grades how well the LLM adheres to a given custom guideline.
2. [Custom Prompt Evaluation](): Evaluate by defining your custom grading prompt.
3. [Cosine Similarity](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/custom/cosine_similarity.ipynb): Calculate cosine similarity between embeddings of two texts.

#### Evaluate the conversation as a whole:
1. [Conversation Satisfaction](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/conversation/conversation_satisfaction.ipynb): Measures the user‚Äôs satisfaction with the conversation with the LLM/AI assistant based on completeness and user‚Äôs acceptance.


# Get started üôå

### Install the package through pip:
```bash
pip install uptrain
```

### How to use UpTrain:

There are two ways to use UpTrain:
1. **Open-source framework:** You can evaluate your responses via the open-source version by providing your OpenAI API key to run evaluations. UpTrain leverages a pipeline comprising GPT-3.5 calls for the same. Note that the evaluation pipeline runs on UpTrain's server but none of the data is logged.

2. **UpTrain API:** You can use UpTrain's managed service to log and evaluate your LLM responses. Just provide your UpTrain API key (no need for OpenAI keys) and UpTrain manages running evaluations for you with real-time dashboards and deep insights.

#### Open-source framework:

Follow the code snippet below to get started with UpTrain.

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, Evals

# Why UpTrain ü§î?

Large language models are trained over billions of data points and perform really well over a wide variety of tasks. But one thing these models are not good at is being deterministic. Even with the most well-crafted prompts, the model can misbehave for certain inputs, be it hallucinations, wrong output structure, toxic or biased response, irrelevant response, and error modes can be immense. 

To ensure your LLM applications work reliably and correctly, UpTrain makes it easy for developers to evaluate the responses of their applications on multiple criteria. UpTrain's evaluation framework can be used to:

1) **Improve performance by 20%** - You can‚Äôt improve what you can‚Äôt measure. UpTrain continuously monitors your application's performance on multiple evaluation criterions and alerts you in case of any regressions with automatic root cause analysis.

1) **Iterate 3x faster** - UpTrain enables fast and robust experimentation across multiple prompts, model providers, and custom configurations, by calculating quantitative scores for direct comparison and optimal prompt selection.

1) **Mitigate LLM Hallucinations** - Hallucinations have plagued LLMs since their inception. By quantifying degree of hallucination and quality of retrieved context, UpTrain helps to detect responses with low factual accuracy and prevent them before serving to the end-users.

# What does UpTrain have to offer? üöÄ

To make it easy for you to evaluate your LLM applications, UpTrain offers:

1) **Diverse LLM Evaluations** - UpTrain provides a diverse set of pre-built metrics like response relevance, context quality, factual accuracy, language quality, etc. to evaluate your LLM applications upon.

1) **Single-line Integration** - With UpTrain's wide array of pre-built metrics, you can run LLM evaluations in less than two minutes.

1) **Customization** - UpTrain is built with customization at its core, allowing you to configure custom grading prompts and operators with just a python function.

first.\n\n2. Create a schedule: Allocate specific time slots for each task or activity throughout the day. Stick to the schedule as much as possible to avoid wasting time or getting overwhelmed.\n\n3. Prioritize and delegate: Determine which tasks can be delegated to others, and be willing to ask for help when needed. Focus on the tasks that only you can do and that align with your goals.\n\n4. Avoid multitasking: Instead of trying to do multiple tasks at once, focus on one task at a time. It enhances concentration and efficiency, leading to better results.\n\n5. Take breaks: Allow yourself short breaks between tasks to refresh and recharge. These breaks can actually boost productivity and prevent burnout.\n\n6. Set deadlines: Establish clear deadlines for yourself to ensure tasks are completed in a timely manner. Avoid procrastination, as it can lead to unnecessary stress and poor time management.\n\n7. Eliminate distractions: Minimize or eliminate distractions around you, such as turning off notifications on your phone or closing unnecessary tabs on your computer. Create a conducive environment for focused work.\n\n8. Learn to say \"no\": Be selective about what commitments you take on. It's okay to decline requests or delegate if you don't have the time or resources to dedicate to them.\n\n9. Break tasks into smaller parts: If a task seems overwhelming, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can make it easier to tackle and less overwhelming.\n\n10. Regularly review and assess: Take some time each week to review your progress, assess what is working well, and make necessary adjustments to your time management strategies.\n\nRemember that effective time management is a personal process, so it's essential to find techniques and strategies that work best for you.
